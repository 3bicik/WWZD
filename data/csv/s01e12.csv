Kent Brockman,good evening again springfield krusty the clown the beloved idol of countless tots now nothing more than a common alleged criminal his trial which begins tomorrow has taken center ring in a national media circus as children of all ages from eight to eighty hang on each new development like so many rumanian trapeze artists
Kent Brockman,from his humble beginnings as a street mime in tupelo mississippi
Kent Brockman,krusty clowned his way to the top of a personal mini-empire --
Kent Brockman,-- with dozens of endorsements including his own line of pork products this may have led to one of televisions best-loved bloopers -- krustys near fatal on-the-air heart attack in 1986
Kent Brockman,but a quick triple bypass and a pacemaker later krusty bounced back however he was a changed clown where his show had been condemned by parents and educators alike as simple-minded tv mayhem
Kent Brockman,this new krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping out illiteracy in todays anything-for-a- thrill youth
Kent Brockman,krustys arrest has sent shock waves through springfield packing its churches synagogues and mosques with disillusioned citizenry from all walks of life
Kent Brockman,so is krusty the clown about to trade in his baggy pants for the relatively snug uniform of springfield penitentiary well find out tomorrow when his trial begins
