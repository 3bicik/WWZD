Kent Brockman,good evening again springfield krusty the clown the beloved idol of countless tots now nothing more than a common alleged criminal his trial which begins tomorrow has taken center ring in a national media circus as children of all ages from eight to eighty hang on each new development like so many rumanian trapeze artists
Kent Brockman,from his humble beginnings as a street mime in tupelo mississippi
Kent Brockman,krusty clowned his way to the top of a personal mini-empire --
Kent Brockman,-- with dozens of endorsements including his own line of pork products this may have led to one of televisions best-loved bloopers -- krustys near fatal on-the-air heart attack in 1986
Homer Simpson,sorry son youll understand one day
Krusty the Clown,wasnt that a great itchy and scratchy cartoon kids well weve got another one coming right up but first i got a hankerin for some pork products
Krusty the Clown,mmmm look plump succulent sausage honey-smoked bacon and glistening sizzling
Krusty the Clown,im dying im dying
Kent Brockman,but a quick triple bypass and a pacemaker later krusty bounced back however he was a changed clown where his show had been condemned by parents and educators alike as simple-minded tv mayhem
Kent Brockman,this new krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping out illiteracy in todays anything-for-a- thrill youth
Krusty the Clown,give a hoot read a book
Kent Brockman,krustys arrest has sent shock waves through springfield packing its churches synagogues and mosques with disillusioned citizenry from all walks of life
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,i urge every halfway decent member of our community to gather up all merchandise that bears the likeness of krusty that clown prince of corruption and join me in a public burning
Kent Brockman,so is krusty the clown about to trade in his baggy pants for the relatively snug uniform of springfield penitentiary well find out tomorrow when his trial begins

Sideshow Bob,framed
Bart Simpson,well the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the kwik-e-mart but krusty couldnt go near the thing not with his pacemaker
Sideshow Bob,well you know bart as much as i love krusty he was never one to take doctors orders too seriously
Bart Simpson,well maybe but get this krusty was illiterate and the guy who robbed the store was reading the springfield review of books
Sideshow Bob,ah well bart

Sideshow Bob,review of books just look at these amusing caricatures of gore vidal and susan sontag
Bart Simpson,yeah i guess those are kinda funny
Sideshow Bob,bart children this whole sordid affair has been a shock to all of us but we must get on with our lives lets try to remember krusty not as a hardened criminal but as that lovable jester who honked his horn and puttered around in his little car
Bart Simpson,and shot you out of a cannon
Sideshow Bob,and shot me out of a cannon yes we will never forget that will we bart open your heart i admit i have some mighty big shoes to fill but if you give me a chance i promise you wont be disap

Bart Simpson,yes sir
Krusty the Clown,thank you
