Edna Krabappel-Flanders,remember to visualize the complex problems and relax the test will start now
Bart Simpson,at seven-thirty am an express train traveling sixty miles an hour leaves santa fe bound for phoenix five hundred and twenty miles away
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,shhhhh visualize it bart
Bart Simpson,at the same time a local train traveling thirty miles an hour and carrying forty passengers leaves phoenix bound for santa fe
Bart Simpson,its eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car
Bart Simpson,an hour later a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off but three times as many plus six get on

Secretary,mr and mrs simpson are here
Seymour Skinner,send them in
Marge Simpson,hello again principal skinner
Homer Simpson,what have you done this time boy
Seymour Skinner,i caught your son defacing school property this morning we estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and frankly we think its terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill
Homer Simpson,yeah its a crummy system but what are you gonna do
Homer Simpson,oh no he cant mean that
Homer Simpson,my wife thinks you want me to pay for it
Seymour Skinner,that was the idea
Homer Simpson,oh
Seymour Skinner,by itself something like this might not call for an extreme penaltybut this is not an isolated incident barts behavior is unruly hes frequently absent from school then gives teachers pathetic excuse notesthat are obviously childish forgeries when compared to
Seymour Skinner,well at any rate it is my reluctant decision --
Secretary,mr skinner doctor pryor is here to see you he says its urgent
Seymour Skinner,send him in
Seymour Skinner,mr and mrs simpson this our district psychiatrist dr j loren pryor
Homer Simpson,what do we need a psychiatrist for we know our kid is nuts

Dr. J. Loren Pyror,your son is a genius mr simpson
Marge Simpson,bart
Homer Simpson,this lunkhead

Dr. J. Loren Pyror,uh-huh do you ever dream of leaving your class to pursue your own intellectual development on an independent basis
Bart Simpson,wow its like youre readin my mind man
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,a-ha you see when a child with barts intellect is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person hes probably going to lash out in ways like these
Seymour Skinner,i think we should re-test him
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,no no i think we should move him to another school
Seymour Skinner,oh better yet
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,bart wed like you to try a kind of school that doesnt rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers a school without walls where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to does that sound good bart

Seymour Skinner,i think were all in a mood to celebrate
Homer Simpson,doc this is all too much i mean my son a genius -- how does it happen
