Dr. J. Loren Pyror,a-ha you see when a child with barts intellect is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person hes probably going to lash out in ways like these
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,no no i think we should move him to another school
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,bart wed like you to try a kind of school that doesnt rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers a school without walls where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to does that sound good bart
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,excellent were all set then heres all the information you need show up around nine-ish mr and mrs simpson congratulations once again
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,well genius-level intelligence is usually the result of heredity and environment
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,uh although in some cases its a total mystery
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,now bart we want to emphasize that nobodys angry about this were were just concerned when a young man with a two hundred sixteen iq cant make a simple experiment work well it doesnt take a bart simpson to figure out that somethings wrong tell me is the class moving too slowly for you

Seymour Skinner,that was the idea
Seymour Skinner,by itself something like this might not call for an extreme penaltybut this is not an isolated incident barts behavior is unruly hes frequently absent from school then gives teachers pathetic excuse notesthat are obviously childish forgeries when compared to
Seymour Skinner,well at any rate it is my reluctant decision --
Seymour Skinner,send him in
