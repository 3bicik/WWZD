Milhouse Van Houten,wow a cherry bomb
Milhouse Van Houten,watch out bart its skinner
Milhouse Van Houten,good morning mr skinner
Milhouse Van Houten,so youre gonna flush it
Seymour Skinner,people people no rough-housing on the monkey bars you there tuck in your shirt watch it i saw that
Seymour Skinner,mother please dont call me spanky on school grounds
Seymour Skinner,morning boys
Seymour Skinner,well mother i would like you to meet milhouse lewis richard and bart simpson
Seymour Skinner,mmm-hmm
Seymour Skinner,simpson lets move on now mother shall we
Seymour Skinner,okay mother this way
Seymour Skinner,now hold it right there you
Seymour Skinner,mother
Seymour Skinner,hello mrs simpson im afraid theres been a very disturbing incident at school today
Seymour Skinner,mmm-hmm i understand completely the disturbing incident i was referring to happened this morning when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys lavatory
Seymour Skinner,unfortunately at the same moment my mother was in the girls lavatory making use of the facilities
Seymour Skinner,mr and mrs simpson we have transcended incorrigible i dont think suspension or expulsion will do the trick i think it behooves us all to consider deportation
Seymour Skinner,well perhaps i was being a tad glib let me explain our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program now normally a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence but in barts case im prepared to make a big exception and if youre willing to play along he can spend the next three months studying far far away
Seymour Skinner,actually hed be staying in france in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine country
Seymour Skinner,oh when hes totally immersed in a foreign language the average child can become fluent in weeks
Seymour Skinner,im sure hell pick up enough to get by and the whole thing wont cost you a dime as long youre willing to take in a student of your own
Seymour Skinner,well for one thing you wouldnt be getting a french boy you would be getting an albanian
Seymour Skinner,no no no no a student from albania its a country on the adriatic sea
Seymour Skinner,mmm-hmm
Seymour Skinner,way to go
Seymour Skinner,you may find his accent peculiar certain aspects of his culture may seem absurd perhaps even offensive but i urge you all to give little adil the benefit of the doubt in this way and only in this way can we hope to better understand our backward neighbors throughout the world
Ugolin,okay kid lets go
Ugolin,hes right you know
Ugolin,cesar look we are rich
Ugolin,and a red hat for you maurice
Ugolin,mmm good sausage
Ugolin,now go to sleep

Ugolin,but its only been fermenting for three days
Ugolin,prison oh my
Ugolin,you put in too much it may kill someone
Ugolin,but it is raining outside lets make the wine tomorrow
Ugolin,then send the boy
