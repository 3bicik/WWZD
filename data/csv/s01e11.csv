Homer Simpson,that old gag
Seymour Skinner,unfortunately at the same moment my mother was in the girls lavatory making use of the facilities
Marge Simpson,oh dear
Seymour Skinner,mr and mrs simpson we have transcended incorrigible i dont think suspension or expulsion will do the trick i think it behooves us all to consider deportation
Marge Simpson,deportation you mean kick bart out of the country
Homer Simpson,hear him out marge
Seymour Skinner,well perhaps i was being a tad glib let me explain our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program now normally a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence but in barts case im prepared to make a big exception and if youre willing to play along he can spend the next three months studying far far away
Homer Simpson,sounds great although a kid cant learn much in just three months
Marge Simpson,homer you didnt even ask where bart would be going
Seymour Skinner,actually hed be staying in france in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine country
Marge Simpson,but bart doesnt speak french
Seymour Skinner,oh when hes totally immersed in a foreign language the average child can become fluent in weeks
Homer Simpson,yeah but what about bart
Seymour Skinner,im sure hell pick up enough to get by and the whole thing wont cost you a dime as long youre willing to take in a student of your own
Homer Simpson,wait a minute skinner how do we know some principal over in france isnt pulling the same scam you are
Seymour Skinner,well for one thing you wouldnt be getting a french boy you would be getting an albanian
Homer Simpson,you mean all white with pink eyes
Seymour Skinner,no no no no a student from albania its a country on the adriatic sea
Marge Simpson,well going to france sounds like a fantastic opportunity but i think bart should have a say in this
Bart Simpson,aah the life of a frog thats the life for me
Marge Simpson,bart how would you like to spend the next three months living in france
Bart Simpson,france wow
Homer Simpson,he makes me crazy twelve months a year at least you get the summer off
